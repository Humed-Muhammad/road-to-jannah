Today, I have come up with the most controversial question and a question that has been there for centuries: Are we alone in the universe? Are there any other intelligent beings other than us in this vast universe? To think we are alone is ridiculous. Do you agree?

**Let us talk about it in light of our tradition, meaning in the light of the Quran and Sunnah. Let us first list the main points we are going to discuss:**

1. Did Allah Create Other Beings Other Than Humans, Animals, Jinns, and Angels?
2. Do we have evidence from the Sunnah or Quran?


## 1. Other Beings
In the recent era, where technologies are booming and advancing, we are seeing huge concerns in the matter of aliens because, in the recent discussion in the American Parliament, UFOs (UnIdentified Flying objects) or now called UAPs (UnIdentified Ariel Phenomena) have been discussed like never before, and the eyewitness reports are huge in numbers.

Is this a glimpse into the existence of other beings that have advanced technologies? That humans will never reach in a thousand years.

Okay, let us wrap our heads around this thing in the light of the Quran. Are they before us, after us, or at the same time like us? That is beside the point, but are there other creations of Allah? Perhaps yes.

What are the verses that indicate we are not alone in this universe?
The first verse will shock you, like it shocked me the first time, because we always recite it five times a day and never pay attention.

### A. Surah Al-Fatiha
ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَـٰلَمِينَ ٢

**Translation:** "All praise is for Allah, Lord of all worlds." (Quran 1:2)

Pay attention to the phrase "all worlds." This can be interpreted to mean that there are multiple worlds. Allah is the Lord of every single Alem (World).

💡 **Note:-** The above verse can be also interpreted to mean that there are multiple worlds in this world meaning our current world, as **Ibn Abase** Siad Over 50 sub worlds.
Example: World of Human, Jinns, Animals, The Water World etc... 

### B. Surah Ash-Shuraa Verse 29

وَمِنْ ءَايَـٰتِهِ خَلْقُ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَثَّ فِيهِمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ جَمْعِهِمْ إِذَا يَشَآءُ قَدِيرٌ ٢٩

**Translation**: "And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and all living beings He scattered throughout heaven and earth. And He is Most Capable of bringing all together whenever He wills." (Quran 42:29)

One could argue that it means this heaven and this earth, meaning our earth and our first heaven, but the term used is plural, meaning multiple heavens. This means there are creatures whom Allah (swa) scattered in the heavens that we don't know.

And the last phrase is "He is capable of causing them to meet if He wants (swa)." This phrase amazes me the most because meeting each other means the creations are hidden from one another.

Some argue that this phrase is meant to be Allah speaking about the Day of Judgment, and this is also a valid point.

Regarding this, I lean towards the opinion of Ibn Taymiyyah (The Scholar of the Umma). More than 700 years ago, Ibn Taymiyyah said and defended the position by saying we are not the only creation of Allah, and it is somehow arrogant to assume we are the only creation of Allah, as Allah is the creator and He (swa) will always continue to create.

And the below verse is, I believe, the most significant evidence to indicate we are not alone in this world.

### C. Surah Al-Isra, Verse 70

۞ وَلَقَدْ كَرَّمْنَا بَنِىٓ ءَادَمَ وَحَمَلْنَـٰهُمْ فِى لْبَرِّ وَلْبَحْرِ وَرَزَقْنَـٰهُم مِّنَ لطَّيِّبَـٰتِ وَفَضَّلْنَـٰهُمْ عَلَىٰ كَثِيرٍ مِّمَّنْ خَلَقْنَا تَفْضِيلًا ٧٠

**Translation**: "Indeed, We have dignified the children of Adam, carried them on land and sea, granted them good and lawful provisions, and privileged them far above many of Our creatures." (Quran 17:70)

This verse has a deep meaning. We know we are the children of Adam, and in the creation, we see meaning around us: animals, jinns, and angels. As we know, Jinns and Angels are ordered to bow for us, and a righteous person is higher than the angels, so we are at the top of the hierarchy.

And the phrase "privileged them far above many of Our creatures" implies that there are other creations privileged higher than us with things we do not have, which is a bit shocking.

But overall, our tradition and the Quran are not explicit regarding the existence of other life forms, but there are references that indicate that there are other life forms. Some verses can be interpreted to indicate that there are other life forms, but what we do not know is whether they live before us, after us, or concurrently with us. That is unknown.

**And Allah Knows Best...**
