# The Ruling On Wiping Over Socks Or Shoes

## Introduction

This article will discuss the ruling on wiping socks or shoes in Islamic jurisprudence. It will cover the conditions that must be met for wiping to be permissible, as well as the correct method of wiping.

In this article, we are going to discuss in detail the **jurisprudence** (**Fiqh**) of wiping over socks or shoes, before I start talking about the **Fiqh** issues, I wanted to start discussing the issue of its permissibility, I bet some of you will be confused and say what I am talking about, I want to rise this that we should now some group or sects say it is not permissible like the **Shias and some section of sufi creeds,** 

But regarding the Ahlusunna WolJemaa, We firmly believe it is permissible and it is a sunnah of our prophet (saw). and there is Ejmaa on this meaning there is a unanimous consensus among our scholars, which is a high level of authority.

And it is part of our **Aqidah** to belief in it, because there are so many **Ahadith (Narrations),** in our books of Hadiths.

## The hadith about the permissibility

There are money **Ahadith** regarding the permissibility of wiping over the socks or shoes but we have selected the most authentic Ahadith there, 

### Sahih Muslim

**The Book of Purification (كتاب الطهارة)**

<aside>
💡 Chapter: Wiping over the khuff (leather socks) (باب الْمَسْحِ عَلَى الْخُفَّيْنِ)

حَدَّثَنَا يَحْيَى بْنُ يَحْيَى التَّمِيمِيُّ، وَإِسْحَاقُ بْنُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ، وَأَبُو كُرَيْبٍ جَمِيعًا عَنْ أَبِي مُعَاوِيَةَ، ح وَحَدَّثَنَا أَبُو بَكْرِ بْنُ أَبِي شَيْبَةَ، حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو مُعَاوِيَةَ، وَوَكِيعٌ، - وَاللَّفْظُ لِيَحْيَى - قَالَ أَخْبَرَنَا أَبُو مُعَاوِيَةَ، عَنِ الأَعْمَشِ، عَنْ إِبْرَاهِيمَ، عَنْ هَمَّامٍ، قَالَ بَالَ جَرِيرٌ ثُمَّ تَوَضَّأَ وَمَسَحَ عَلَى خُفَّيْهِ فَقِيلَ تَفْعَلُ هَذَا ‏.‏ فَقَالَ نَعَمْ رَأَيْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم بَالَ ثُمَّ تَوَضَّأَ وَمَسَحَ عَلَى خُفَّيْهِ ‏.‏ قَالَ الأَعْمَشُ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ كَانَ يُعْجِبُهُمْ هَذَا الْحَدِيثُ لأَنَّ إِسْلاَمَ جَرِيرٍ كَانَ بَعْدَ نُزُولِ الْمَائِدَةِ ‏

**Hummam reported:**

Jarir urinated, then performed ablution and wiped over the socks. It was said to him: Do you do like this? He said: Yes, I saw that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) urinated, then performed ablution, and then wiped over his shoes. A'mash said: Ibrahim had observed that this hadith was a surprise for them (the people) because Jarir had embraced Islam after the revelation of Surat al-Ma'ida.

</aside>

I firmly believe that this Hadith effectively settles any doubts about the permissibility of wiping over socks or shoes

Now let us list the issue of **Fiqh** we are going to discuss late in the article: 

 

1. The type of socks and shoes
2. The time period, meaning the time period between the first wiping to the end of the wiping time.
3. Do removing the socks nullify the wudu

### The Type of Socks and Shoes

This section will briefly go over the type of socks and shoes that are permissible to wipe over, as there is great confusion among the average Muslim like us. We went over various scholarly opinions and gathered each opinion to present them in your hand.

Before we continue we wanted you our readers to know the difference of opinion is mostly centered on the type of socks, not the shoes.

**Regarding the Shoes**

The only requirement for wiping over the shoe is that the shoes must cover the ankle completely. In this, we can continue with the issues of the socks.

**Regarding the Socks**

The above rule also applies to the socks, the socks must cover the ankles completely too. Now the question remains what type of socks means is the socks must be a tick or can we use thin socks also?

There are two major scholarly opinions regarding this issue, one says the socks must be thick enough that the skin of the person is not visible under it and this is the majority opinion. 

The second opinion says that any type of socks is permissible given that it covers the ankles.

### List of opinions

According to **Shaykh Ibn Baaz**, one of the requirements for it to be acceptable to wipe over socks is that they must be thick and provide proper coverage. If the socks are thin, it is not allowed to wipe over them. This is because in such a case, the foot is considered as being uncovered.

**From Fataawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (10/110)**

According to **An-Nawawi**, it is acceptable to wipe over socks, even if they are thin. This is based on narrations from companions such as 'Umar, 'Ali, Abu Yoosuf, Muhammad, Ishaaq, and Dawood - may Allah be pleased with them.

**From al-Majmoo‘ Sharh al-Muhadhdhab (1/500)**

According to Shaykh al-Albaani and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on them), this viewpoint was considered more accurate.

But overall regarding the permissibility of thin socks the majority of the scholar agreed upon it is not permissible to wipe over thin socks.

In conclusion, most scholars believe that wiping over thin socks is not permitted and that permission to do so is restricted to thick socks. Ultimately, Allah knows best.

## Time period

Based on the genuine Sunnah, there is a specific time frame for wiping over socks. For individuals who are not traveling, this duration is one day and one night **(24 hrs)**. However, for those who are traveling, it is extended to three days and nights **(72 hrs)**.

Muslim, narrated that Shurayh ibn Haani’ said: I came to ‘Aa’ishah and asked her about wiping over the khuffayn. She said: You should go to (‘Ali) ibn Abi Taalib and ask him, for he used to travel with the Messenger of Allaah (S). So we asked him and he said: The Messenger of Allaah (S) set a limit of three days and nights for the traveller, and one day and night for one who is not travelling.

**Muslim (276)**

**Al-Tirmidhi**, **Abu Dawood** and **Ibn Majaah** narrated from Khuzaymah ibn Thaabit (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked about wiping over the khuffayn and he said: “For the traveller it is three (days) and for the non-traveller it is one day.” **Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi**.

**Al-Tirmidhi (95), Abu Dawood (157) and Ibn Majaah (553)**

It is widely accepted among scholars that the period for wiping over socks commences after the first time a person wipes over them following the break of their wudoo'. It should be noted that this period does not start from when the socks are first put on. To illustrate, if an individual performs wudoo' for Fajr prayer and wears socks, subsequently breaks their wudoo' at 9 a.m. without reperforming it, and then does wudoo' again at 12 p.m., the wiping period begins at 12 p.m. and lasts for a duration of 24 hours, encompassing one day and one night.

## Do Removing the Socks Nullify the Wudoo

Taking off your socks while having wudoo will not invalidate it. However, it is important to note that if you break your wudoo while not wearing socks, you will not be able to wipe over them and will need to perform a new wudoo by washing your feet. After completing the original wudoo, you may put your socks or shoes back on and continue wiping over them.
